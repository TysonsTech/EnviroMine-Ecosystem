# EnviroMine-Ecosystem
Initiate discussion to re-purpose and rebrand the helium LoRa miner ecosystem into the world's largest Environmentally friendly ultra-low-power multi-token multi-service provider

 Called EnviroMine the new ecosystem would incorporate (LoRa, dVPN, IPFS File Storage, WiFi, and potentially 5G) 5G would need to be optional based on the current cost of entry. We could launch 5 tokens to start with the simple addition of a 5-10 TB USB SSD HD customers add to their miners with the OS and storage we will need. Customers decide what they want to stake toward each project. We could store all the minted NFTs we will have on our own IPFS system.
