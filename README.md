Initiate discussion to re-purpose, rebrand and broaden the helium LoRa miner ecosystem into the world's largest Environmentally friendly ultra-low-power multi-token incentivized, multi-protocol, global distributed service provider. LoRa (IoT token), dVPN (Boring token), IPFS (filecoin token), WiFi (WiFi Token), and 5G  (Helium Mobile token requires additional radio purchase). With more to come.

BRANDING: EnviroMine, the new global ecosystem composed of Low power environmentally friendly devices called The EnviroMiner, will generate cryptocurrency as the sustaining economic driver of ecosystem growth. Combined with a focus on bringing the people of the world together with one goal. To solve a common purpose of providing data and a repository to make our planet a better place to live. (LoRa, WiFi, dVPN, IPFS, 5G, etc...) 

ENVIRONMENTAL FOCUS: The Environmental focus and mission of EnviroMine would be to utilize the existing global network of low-power ARM-based computers (Helium LoRa Miner hardware) already online worldwide, combined with web3, blockchain, and various wireless technologies to improve our planet through real-time environmental, population, geophysical, and atmospheric data acquisition, processing, and storage for global availability through purchased API's.. (free for environmental scientists of course)

I believe in utilizing technology for the greater good. No greater good exists than the planet providing the air and water we need. We must unite as Earth's inhabitants with a mission to save it. Data and accurate information should be the basis for all decisions. The EnviroMine ecosystem will provide the data we need, match our low power focus, and empower an economic token-based incentive model to fund and grow the ecosystem. 

Environmental data: Enabling the availability of this data to help understand our planet's ecological systems in real-time, populations, food supplies, agricultural trends, weather patterns, forecasting, hell, we can even track space debris. Imagine a ubiquitous global network of sensors, trackers, mappers, weather stations, and space mappers, all feeding data into a worldwide decentralized IPFS that everyone could access. All are powered by and connected via the existing fleet of Helium LoRa miners.

MOTIVATION: "A Multi Token upgrade implementation would immediately and relevantly re-purposes the no longer needed processing power of the nearly one million LoRa Hotspots sitting online worldwide into the most extensive environmentally friendly token supported, data mining network right out of the box. The initial launch includes four tokens added to the LoRa miner lineup. Give the customer ability to switch modes right in the app and add the stake to support dVPN token SubDAO along with IPFS, IoT, MOBILE & WIFI.

HARDWARE: Existing - All services and tokens are running under4 a low-power ARM-based processor RPI4b or 4GB ram or better, utilizing less than 10 watts. Add-on drives to gain IPFS functionality and more:  If we added only 1TB USB SSDs to 500K online miners, we would have ~500 petabytes to sell right off the bat. More the merrier to store data from ecosystem partners. 

LoRa: Provides ultra-low power and long-range connectivity to global field sensors gathering temperature, humidity, barometric pressure data, and more. Feeds information to global oracle.

dVPN: Protocol and token to power encryption algorithms to secure traffic on the network connecting dVPN and IPFS users. 

IPFS: This might be the key to unlocking a V.2 ecosystem by enabling all other services, as we will have the ability to run an OS on an external HD to control the multi-functions of the Enviromine hardware. IPFS secured with Boring VPN tunnels provides global connectivity and data availability. IPFS mining ability would come with the purchase of a 5-10 TB USB SSD HD customers add to their miners with the OS and storage we will need to expand future offerings. Customers decide what tokens they want to allocate and stake. We store all the minted hotspot NFTs and archive our blockchain data on our IPFS system.

WiFi: Local wireless service could be accomplished with WiFi6 USB adapters. TBD. 

RESOURCES TO BE CONSERVED: - Water, the most simple of life's elements. Our sensors will enable more efficient agricultural, industrial and commercial. One of the many environmental solutions the EnviroMine Network can provide.
