# EnviroMine-Ecosystem - Stream of thought notes on Helium Ecosystem.

Initiate discussion to re-purpose and rebrand the helium LoRa miner ecosystem into the world's largest Environmentally friendly ultra-low-power multi-token incentivised, multi-protocol service provider (LoRa (IoT token), dVPN (Boring Bop token), IPFS (filecoin token), WiFi (WiFi Token), On 5G gateways only (Helium Mobile token w/ radio purchase). And more to come.

Called EnviroMine, the new ecosystem would incorporate (LoRa, dVPN, IPFS File Storage, WiFi, and 5G) 5G would need to be optional based on the current cost of entry. Initial launch includes 5 tokens added to the miner. IPFS comes with the addition of a 5-10 TB USB SSD HD customers add to their miners with the OS and storage we will need to expand offerings. Customers decide what they want to stake toward each project. We store all the minted hotspot NFTs and archive our blockchain data on our own IPFS system. 

The focus and mission would be to utilize the existing global network of low-power ARM-based computers (Helium LoRa Miner hardware) already online worldwide, combined with web3, blockchain, and various wireless technologies to improve our planet through real-time global environmental, geophysical, and atmospheric data acquisition and processing and storage for global availability. 

ENVIRONMENTAL FOCUS: I believe in utilizing technology for the greater good. There is no greater good than the planet that provides the air we breathe. We must unite as inhabitants of the same planet with a mission to save it. Data and accurate information should be the basis for all decisions. 
The EnviroMine ecosystem matches both our low power focus and economic token-based incentive model.  

DATA: Enabling the availability of this data to help understand our planet's environmental systems in real-time, populations, food supplies, agricultural trends, weather patterns, forecasting, hell, we can even track space debris. Imagine a ubiquitous global network of sensors, trackers, mappers, weather stations, and space mappers, all feeding data into a global decentralized IPFS that everyone could access. all powered by and connected via the existing fleet of Helium LoRa miners.

MOTIVATIONS: "A Multi Token upgrade implementation would immediately and relevantly re-purposes the no longer needed processing power of the nearly one million LoRa Hotspots sitting online worldwide into the largest environmentally friendly token supported, data mining network right out of the box. Give the customer ability to switch modes right in the app and add the stake to support dVPN token SubDAO along with IPFS, IoT, MOBILE & WIFI to start.

HARDWARE: Existing - All services and tokens running under the low-power ARM-based processor RPI4b or 4GB ram or better. Add-on drive to gain IPFS functionality and more:  If we added only 1TB USB SSDs to 500K online miners, we would have 500 petabytes to sell right off the bat. More the merrier to store data from ecosystem partners. 

LoRa: Provides ultra-low power and long-range connectivity to global field sensors gathering temperature, humidity, barometric pressure data, and more. Feeds it into 

dVPN: Protocol and token to power encryption algorithms to secure traffic on the network connecting dVPN and IPFS users. 

IPFS -  This might be the key to enabling all other services as we will have the ability to run an OS on an external HD to control the multi-functions of the Enviromine hardware. IPFS secured with Boring VPN tunnels provides global connectivity and data availability. 

WiFi: Local wireless service tbd. 

POTENTIAL Partners / ecosystem service providers: Potential organizations to invite into the EnviroMine global ecosystem: Hivemapper, DIMO, Weather XM, React Network, Boring Protocol, FileCoin, RevoFi, SKY360, Community Fi, MATCHx, DataHighway.
