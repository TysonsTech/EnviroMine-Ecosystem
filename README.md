# EnviroMine-Ecosystem - Notes on The Helium Ecosystem.

Initiate discussion to re-purpose, broaden and rebrand the helium LoRa miner ecosystem into the world's largest Environmentally friendly ultra-low-power multi-token incentivized, multi-protocol global distributed service provider. LoRa (IoT token), dVPN (Boring Bop token), IPFS (filecoin type token), WiFi (WiFi Token), and 5G  (Helium Mobile token requires additional radio purchase). With more to come.

Called EnviroMine, the new global ecosystem is composed of Low power environmentally friendly devices mining cryptocurrency as the main driver of ecosystem growth. Combined with a focus on bringing the people of the world together to solve a common goal of providing data to help make our planet a better place to live. (LoRa, WiFi, 5G, dVPN, IPFS, etc...) {5G would need to be optional based on the current cost of entry}. 

IPFS mining ability would come with the purchase of a 5-10 TB USB SSD HD customers add to their miners with the OS and storage we will need to expand future offerings. Customers decide what tokens they want to allocate and stake. We store all the minted hotspot NFTs and archive our blockchain data on our IPFS system.   

The Environmental focus and mission would be to utilize the existing global network of low-power ARM-based computers (Helium LoRa Miner hardware) already online worldwide, combined with web3, blockchain, and various wireless technologies to improve our planet through the real-time global environmental, population, geophysical, and atmospheric data acquisition and processing and storage for global availability through purchased API's.. (free for environmental scientists of course)

ENVIRONMENTAL FOCUS: I believe in utilizing technology for the greater good. There is no greater good than the planet that provides the air we breathe. We must unite as inhabitants of the same planet with a mission to save it. Data and accurate information should be the basis for all decisions. 
The EnviroMine ecosystem can provide the data we need, matches both our low power focus, and empowers an economic token-based incentive model to grow the ecosystem.  

DATA: Enabling the availability of this data to help understand our planet's environmental systems in real-time, populations, food supplies, agricultural trends, weather patterns, forecasting, hell, we can even track space debris. Imagine a ubiquitous global network of sensors, trackers, mappers, weather stations, and space mappers, all feeding data into a global decentralized IPFS that everyone could access. all powered by and connected via the existing fleet of Helium LoRa miners.

MOTIVATIONS: "A Multi Token upgrade implementation would immediately and relevantly re-purposes the no longer needed processing power of the nearly one million LoRa Hotspots sitting online worldwide into the largest environmentally friendly token supported, data mining network right out of the box. The initial launch includes 4 tokens added to the LoRa miner lineup. Give the customer ability to switch modes right in the app and add the stake to support dVPN token SubDAO along with IPFS, IoT, MOBILE & WIFI.

HARDWARE: Existing - All services and tokens running under a low-power ARM-based processor RPI4b or 4GB ram or better. Utilizing less than 20 watts. Add-on drives to gain IPFS functionality and more:  If we added only 1TB USB SSDs to 500K online miners, we would have ~500 petabytes to sell right off the bat. More the merrier to store data from ecosystem partners. 

LoRa: Provides ultra-low power and long-range connectivity to global field sensors gathering temperature, humidity, barometric pressure data, and more. Feeds it into 

dVPN: Protocol and token to power encryption algorithms to secure traffic on the network connecting dVPN and IPFS users. 

IPFS -  This might be the key to enabling all other services as we will have the ability to run an OS on an external HD to control the multi-functions of the Enviromine hardware. IPFS secured with Boring VPN tunnels provides global connectivity and data availability. 

WiFi: Local wireless service could be accomplished with WiFi6 usb adapters. TBD. 

RESOURCES TO BE CONSERVED: - Water, the most simple of life's elements, will become a valuable resource if it is not already. Our sensors will enable much more efficient agricultural use of it. One of the so many environmental solutions EnviroMine Network can provide.
